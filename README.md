# sequelizedBurger


## Description
This is a full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user can enter a burger name to add it to the menu. This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The burger entry is added on the menu under "Burgers" located towards the top of the screen. 
The user may then eat any burger by clicking on the associated "Devour" button. This will move it to the "Devoured Burger" section of the page and updates the status accordingly on the mySQL database.
The user may also delete any "Devoured" burger from the list to remove it completely. This will also remove the entry from the database.
